# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple daily planner where:

- The current day is displayed at the top on opening the application and you can select any day you desire using a calendar
- On scrolling down there are 1 hour blocks during normal business hours for scheduled events or tasks
- Time blocks are color coded to indicate past(gray), present(red), and future(green)
- Clicking on a time block, you can enter an event or task
- Events or tasks will be saved to localStorage so that they persist on refresh


## Installation

Being a web application, there is no installation per se.  A local file is created in the browser that can be deleted through the Developer Tools or by clearing all browser data.

## Usage

Run at this link:  https://melliott7264.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

On initial load, the calendar comes up showing the current day's schedule.  To select another day, click on the field marked "Click to Select Date:".  A calendar will pop up.  Just select the date desired and the schedule for that day will be loaded.  To add/edit an event, click anywhere in the event description block to the right of the hour block.  A text entry box will appear.  Click in the text entry box and type in the event information you desire.  When you are finished, just move the mouse cursor out of the text entry box.  Your event will be automatically saved.   To be sure, you can click on the blue Save button to the far right.  Click on the Clear button to remove the event from the database.  On clear, you will be asked to confirm that you want to delete the event from the database.
